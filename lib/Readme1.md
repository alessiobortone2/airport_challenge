Solution proposed by Alessio Bortone

1. Assumptions made.
  For the sake of simplicity, in this case I assumed that:
  - weather is same across all airports (ie, stormy or sunny at the same time everywhere)
  - distribution is point-to-point, not hub and spoke: therefore, all airports have the same importance
  - capacity is the same for all airports (ie, only one constant defines capacity across all airports)


2. Approach to problem.

I interpreted


3. Notes.

- Weather is assumed to be 0 = sunny / 1 = stormy (where 0 and 1 can be generated by the rand(0..1) function)
